# Digital Forensics Fundamentals Lab

## Overview
This project introduces the fundamentals of digital forensics
through the analysis of simulated system evidence.

The goal is to understand how logs, artifacts, and system data
can be used to reconstruct events during a security incident.

## Disclaimer
All evidence used in this project is simulated.
No real user data or production systems are involved.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated how digital forensic techniques can be used
to analyze system logs, reconstruct timelines, and assess potential
security incidents.

The lab emphasized ethical investigation, evidence integrity,
and clear documentation of findings.
